Go to Infile and enter your points, line 1 is = x1 
                                    line 2 is = x2
                                    line 3 is = y1
                                    line 4 is = y2
                                    line 5 is = z1
                                    line 6 is = z2

Once you have done that go to main.py and run the file.
